- What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
  something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
  when others do the same for your code?

  ANSWER: An important part of code reviews is providing both negative and
  positive feedback. It's hard for anyone to only recieve negative feedback on 
  everyting they do and this is why its important to also mention the positives 
  of their work too. Readability is also important and I appreciate when others
  tell me my code is unreadable. I also enjoy when others tell how I can 
  refactor my code when it was not obvious to myself.

  - We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
  slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help
  us improve this situation?

  ANSWER: Using a container would help the above described situation by letting
  the server  operator run all of their "slightly different things" in one 
  virtual enviroment as images. This way you could manage all of your computer 
  enviroments from a single location while still letting all of them have the 
  nuances that existed previously.
